# Conditional-Functions-in-C
This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of functions with return values and void functions to handle conditional logic and computations. The programs covers tasks such as checking even or odd numbers, calculating commissions, validating triangles, determining grades, and more.
## 1.Queation number
This project addresses ****Bachelor of Science in Apllied Information Technology**** class activity week-8(functions conditions).
## 2.Description
_**objective:**_
This project demonstrates how to use functions in **C programming functions** to:
1. Perform conditional checks.
2. Solve real-world problems involving commissions calculation, validations, and classifications.
3. Seperate logic in to modular functions for better redability and maintainability.
## 3.Installation steps
1. clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile any of the C files using C compiler
4. Run the compiled program
## 4.Usage
Run individual program to solve specific problems
_examples_

1. Check evenor odd:

   Output: Displays one for 1, 0 for odd

3. Calculate commission

   Input: Quantity and price of marketed items.

   Output: Display commission earned for each item
5. Determine voter eligibility

   Input: Age of the person

   Output: Displays "eligible to vote" or "not eligible to vote"
## 5.Features of the program
1. comprehensive conditional logic:

   Includes checks for grades, triangle validity, and more
2. Commissioon calculation

   Calculates commission for tools based on specific sales thresholds.
4. Modular design:

   Functions are reusable and neatly organised for easy understanding.
6. Flexible inputs:

   Allow user-defined inputs for dynamic calculations.
